# Slot-machine status — JS client landed, splice follow-up

## What this PR adds

- **`packages/slots`** — `@endo/slots`, a JavaScript client that
  speaks the slot-machine wire protocol byte-for-byte with the Rust
  crate.
  - Canonical CBOR encoder/decoder (minimal-head integers; no
    indefinite lengths; RFC 8949 §4.2).
  - `Descriptor` 2-element array `[kindByte, position]` with the
    reference fixture `Descriptor(Local, Object, 0)` → `82 00 00`.
  - Four payload codecs: `deliver`, `resolve`, `drop`, `abort`.
  - Per-session c-list (`makeCList`) with monotonic counters matching
    the Rust `Session`.
  - `SessionId` derived as SHA-256 of `"slots/session/" + label`.
  - `makeSlotMarshaller` on top of `@endo/marshal`, packing method
    calls and resolutions into wire payloads with c-list-backed slot
    translation.  All capabilities share a flat `targets` array on
    the wire (kind byte disambiguates); `promises` stays empty since
    the Rust supervisor's `translate_slice` handles both arrays
    identically.
- **Pinned wire fixtures on both sides** — an empty-label SessionId
  and `worker-1` SessionId hex digests appear in both
  `packages/slots/test/session.test.js` and
  `rust/endo/slots/src/session.rs`.  Any divergence will fail either
  `yarn test` in `packages/slots` or `cargo test -p slots`.
- **CapTP baseline** captured in `captp-baseline.md`; 52 JS unit
  tests (descriptor / cbor / payload / session / clist / marshaller)
  plus 39 Rust unit tests (previously 37) are green.

## What's explicitly not in this PR

### The daemon splice

Integrating `@endo/slots` into `bus-daemon-rust-xs.js` and
`bus-worker-node-raw.js` so worker-to-worker traffic uses
`deliver`/`resolve`/`drop`/`abort` envelopes instead of CapTP is
substantially more work than the client itself.  Stage 1
(marshaller) ships here.  Stage 2 requires:

1. ~~A slot-machine-aware marshaller on each worker~~ — **done**
   via `makeSlotMarshaller`.
2. Presence-factory wiring so `E(presence).method()` queues a
   `deliver` against the descriptor of `presence` without awaiting
   resolution (for pipelining).  Uses `HandledPromise` and a
   reply-promise table.
3. Error marshalling (`resolve` with `is_reject=1`).  The
   marshaller already supports the flag; the bus must route errors
   through it instead of CapTP's error encoding.
4. A no-regression path for worker-to-daemon traffic, which stays
   on CapTP until the daemon's bootstrap is itself slot-machine-shaped.

The Rust supervisor already attempts `translate_deliver` /
`translate_resolve` on every `deliver`/`resolve` envelope it routes
(see `supervisor.rs:362`), and falls through silently when the
payload does not decode as canonical CBOR with the slot-machine
shape.  That means CapTP-over-`deliver` traffic continues to work
unchanged — the splice is non-regressive in the sense that a JS
client emitting slot-machine CBOR on the same verb will be handled
correctly, but nothing today emits that shape.

### The benchmark comparison

`captp-baseline.md` stands.  The comparison run belongs to the PR
that ships the splice, since slot-machine traffic requires a
marshaller swap to exist on the wire at all.

## Next step

A follow-up PR that:

1. Replaces worker↔daemon and worker↔worker CapTP with a
   slot-machine marshaller, starting with a feature-flagged
   (`ENDO_USE_SLOT_MACHINE=1`) opt-in.
2. Measures the Rust+XS `worker_to_worker_ping` /
   `worker_to_worker_echo_1kib` deltas versus the baseline in
   `captp-baseline.md`.
3. Writes the delta to `slot-machine-result.md` alongside the
   baseline.
